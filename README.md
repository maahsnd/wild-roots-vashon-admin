# Wild Roots Admin

This repo is for the administrative portal and CMS of Wild Roots Kitchen & Farm: a farm and catering business located on Vashon Island, WA. The menu, farm stand, and farmers
market offerings are updated weekly via a custom built administrative CMS that leverages Google's Firebase to share data between two React applications. This allows the business
owner to update text and images in an easy, convenient manner. My goal was to design a simple, no-frills CMS that the business owner could use to update their sit content.
Accordingly, design is, shall we say, minimalist. Feature-wise, it allows for the menu, farm stand, and farmers market pages to be fully editable, photos included.
